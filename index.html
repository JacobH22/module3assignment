        <h2>Deathbat Nation</h2>

        <p>Avenged Sevenfold are currently in the studio recording their follow up album to 2014's The Stage. With no tour dates scheduled, the band will be putting a lot of their time into perfecting their sound for their next album! In the meantime, they are treating the fans to a re-release of 2008's Diamonds in the Rough onto all streaming platforms. The re-release will include all of the original tracks plus 5 bonus tracks, including the previously unreleased single Set Me Free!</p>
